                                <p>
                                    Our Lego robot construction curriculum covers all age groups from preschoolers to K-12 students.  Children are encouraged to learn more about the world using science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills, stimulating their interest in STEM subjects.
                                    In Lego robot building classes, students are guided by instructors to build their Lego creations based on the topic of the building class, and afterwards learn more about what they built. There are three stages in Lego building classes, including preschool level classes targeted to children 3 to 6 years old, “building with technology“ classes for 7- to 8-year-olds, and building classes involving programing for 9 to 12-year-old students.  The learning packet for each age group is divided into four sets of class instruction materials that utilize the “4C” instructional method: connect, construct, contemplate and continue. Through the four stages of instruction, the children learn about the object they are building and then construct it. During the learning process, students gain higher levels of spatial imagination, logical thinking, teamwork spirit, and public speaking abilities. After the completion of each instructional set, we will hold a ceremony for students and issue course completion certificates.

                                <p>We coach children getting ready to take part in the VEX competitions by using teaching materials targeted at all aspects in the competition revolving around the theme that year. VEX competition involves two stages: VEX IQ, for which 8 to 13-year-olds are eligible; and VEX EDR, which only 14 to 18-year-olds can enter. The course materials all include Lego construction and program writing. VEX IQ construction requires plastic building materials, and VEX EDR uses metal. The core of materials used in coaching is formed with STEM education at the central point, with a main goal of cultivating children’s passion for STEM learning.</p>

                                    Most American students attend summer and winter camps during their vacation. Summer camps tend to be more popular.  Students from all corners of the world come to the U.S. during summer each year to experience the American summer camp, which has become a part of American culture. Our science camp activities are distinct from our class instructional materials. In addition, we provide training targeted especially for competitions such as FIRST and VEX. We encourage our members to take part in contests to build their competitive skills, cultivate their independence, boost their self-confidence, and apply what they have learned in class to excel in these competitions.
                                    More importantly, we will fully utilize our advantage as a cross-nation company and build a platform for cultural exchange between Chinese and American children besides providing technological  . Through living in host families, campers will gain a deeper understanding of life in America and achieve cross-nation and cross-culture collaboration through working on projects together with their teammates.
